## 🕰️ Corporate History

**Submeson Brain Corporation: A Timeline of Mildly Controlled Chaos**

- **1983 – The Spark**  
  Founded in a garage next to a chip shop somewhere in the UK, SBC began as a failed attempt to interface a ZX81 with a Sinclair C5 using only coat hangers and optimism. The project was abandoned after the C5 developed a personality and demanded stereo output.

- **1987 – The Sentimental Tape Deck**  
  A tape deck named Trevor was briefly hired as Head of Media Archival. Sentimental and stubborn, Trevor insisted all memos be recorded in reverse and stored on TDK D90s. He was later retired after attempting to overwrite the company’s bootloader with a mixtape.

- **1992 – The Jumper Renaissance**  
  SBC engineers began naming jumper configurations after synth bands. This led to the infamous “Depeche Mode Logic Trap,” which caused the ZX81 to boot into a loop of existential questions. The bug was never fixed. It was rebranded as a feature.

- **2001 – The Silence**  
  A brief hiatus occurred when the company attempted to develop a silent modem that communicated via ambient room temperature. No one could confirm if it worked. The project was quietly shelved.

- **2023 – The Reboot**  
  Under the leadership of bambleweeny57, SBC re-emerged with ZXEightyZON Rev1.0 and TouchDuino. The company embraced modularity, remixability, and the belief that cassette interfaces deserved touchscreens and reverence.

- **2025 – Present Day**  
  SBC continues to operate from its uplink station HQ, releasing annotated logic maps, touchscreen cassette players, and documentation written in faux-corporate memos. Rumors persist of a vending machine in the break room that only dispenses blank EPROMs and unsolicited advice.

## 📝 Founder’s Note

> “Submeson Brain Corporation started as a joke between jumper wires and coffee breaks. But somewhere between the GAL logic maps and cassette UI overlays, it became a real platform—one that celebrates the joy of building, remixing, and storytelling through hardware.  
> If you’re reading this, you’re part of the retroverse now. Welcome aboard.”
